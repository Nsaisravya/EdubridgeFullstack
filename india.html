    <h2>Reception</h2>
    <h4>'Revolutionary Terrorist' controversy</h4>
    Bhagat Singh along with Chandra Shekhar Azad, Surya Sen and others have been referred as 'revolutionary terrorist' 
    in chapter 20 of book.[2] Bhagat Singh's family objected the use of term in April of 2016.[3] In parliamentary upper 
    house Rajya Sabha, K. C. Tyagi, Janata Dal (United) politician, demanded to delete "objectionable references" for 
    Bhagat Singh.[2] P. J. Kurien, deputy chairman of house, urged government to remove all references which refer 
    Bhagat Singh as "revolutionary terrorist" which was assured by Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, then Ministry of Parliamentary 
    Affairs.[2] Samajwadi Party politician Naresh Agarwal along with BJP MPs demanded action against authors while Left 
    MPs opposed it in Rajya Sabha.<br>
    <br>
    In May 2016, Hindutva activist Dinanath Batra wrote a letter to HRD Ministry to sought ban on the book for the very same 
    reason.[2][1] He also demanded action against Delhi University officials who printed it in Hindi.<br>
    <br>
    Mridula Mukherjee, co-author of the book had clarified that word didn't have a pejorative meaning when it was published.
    Professors of Jawaharlal Nehru University claimed that Bipan Chandra praised Bhagat Singh when he referred him as 
    'revolutionary terrorist'.[5] Later, the book was red-flagged by the Delhi University.[6] Indian History Congress 
    had passed a resolution in favor of book and demanded to end 'virtual ban' on the book in 2017.<br>
