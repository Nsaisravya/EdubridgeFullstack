         <br>
    <b>A Wrinkle in Time</b>is a young adult novel written by American author Madeleine L'Engle. First published in 1962, 
    the book won the Newbery Medal, the Sequoyah Book Award, the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award, and was runner-up for the 
    Hans Christian Andersen Award.[3][a] The main characters—Meg Murry, Charles Wallace Murry, and Calvin O'Keefe—embark
     on a journey through space and time, from galaxy to galaxy, as they endeavor to save the Murrys' father and the 
     world. The novel offers a glimpse into the war between light and darkness, and good and evil, as the young 
     characters mature into adolescents on their journey.[4] The novel wrestles with questions of spirituality and 
     purpose, as the characters are often thrown into conflicts of love, divinity, and goodness. It is the first book 
     in L'Engle's Time Quintet, which follows the Murrys and Calvin O'Keefe. <br>
     <br>
     L'Engle modeled the Murry family on her own. Scholar Bernice E. Cullinan noted that L'Engle created characters who 
     "share common joy with a mixed fantasy and science fiction setting." The novel's scientific and religious undertones
      are therefore highly reflective of the life of L'Engle.<br>
      <br>
      The book has inspired two film adaptations, both by Disney: a 2003 television film directed by John Kent Harrison, and 
      a 2018 theatrical film directed by Ava DuVernay. <br>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    Raised in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, author Madeleine L'Engle began writing at a young age.After graduating from boarding school
     in Switzerland, she attended Smith College, where she earned a degree in English.[8] In addition to writing, 
     L'Engle also gained experience as an actor and playwright.At age forty, she nearly abandoned her career as a 
     novelist, but continued to write after her publication of Meet the Austins.<br>
     <br>
     L'Engle wrote A Wrinkle in Time between 1959 and 1960. In her memoir, A Circle of Quiet (1972), L'Engle explains that 
     the book was conceived "during a time of transition."After years of living in rural Goshen, Connecticut where they 
     ran a general store, L'Engle's family, the Franklins, moved back to New York City, first taking a ten-week camping 
     trip across the country. L'Engle writes that "we drove through a world of deserts and buttes and leafless mountains, 
     wholly new and alien to me. And suddenly into my mind came the names, Mrs Whatsit. Mrs Who. Mrs Which." This was in 
     the spring of 1959. When asked for more information in an interview with Horn Book magazine in 1983, L'Engle responded 
     "I cannot possibly tell you how I came to write it. It was simply a book I had to write. I had no choice. It was only 
     after it was written that I realized what some of it meant." L'Engle has also described the novel as her "psalm of 
     praise to life, [her] stand for life against death."<br>
     <br>
     Additionally, L'Engle drew upon her interest in science. The novel includes references to Einstein's theory of relativity 
     and Planck's quantum theory.<br>
     <h2>Plot summary</h2>
     One night, thirteen-year-old Meg Murry meets an eccentric new neighbor, Mrs Whatsit, who refers to something called a tesseract. She 
     later finds out it is a scientific concept her father was working on before his mysterious disappearance. The following 
     day, Meg, her child genius brother Charles, and fellow schoolmate Calvin visit Mrs Whatsit's home, where the equally 
     strange Mrs Who and the unseen voice of Mrs Which promise to help Meg find and rescue her father.<br>
     <br>
     Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who, and Mrs Which turn out to be supernatural beings who transport Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin O'Keefe through the 
     universe by means of a tesseract, a fifth-dimensional phenomenon explained as folding the fabric of space and time; this form of travel 
     is called tessering. Their first stop is the planet Uriel, a Utopian world filled with Centaur-like beings who live in a state of light 
     and love. The Mrs Ws reveal to the children that the universe is under attack from an evil being who appears as a large dark cloud called 
     The Black Thing, which is essentially the personification of evil. The children are taken to Orion's Belt to visit the Happy Medium, a 
     woman with a crystal ball through which they see that Earth is partially covered by the darkness, although great religious figures, 
     philosophers, scientists, and artists have been fighting against it. Mrs Whatsit is revealed to be a former star who exploded in an act 
     of self-sacrifice to fight the darkness.<br>
