    <b>The Little Prince</b>(French: Le Petit Prince, pronounced is a novella by French aristocrat, 
    writer, and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. It was first published in English and French in the US by Reynal & 
    Hitchcock in April 1943, and posthumously in France following the liberation of France as Saint-Exupéry's works had
     been banned by the Vichy Regime. The story follows a young prince who visits various planets in space, including 
     Earth, and addresses themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss. Despite its style as a children's book, 
     The Little Prince makes observations about life, adults and human nature.<br>
     <br>
     The Little Prince became Saint-Exupéry's most successful work, selling an estimated 140 million copies worldwide, which 
     makes it one of the best-selling and most translated books ever published. It has been translated into 301 languages 
     and dialects. The Little Prince has been adapted to numerous art forms and media, including audio recordings, radio 
     plays, live stage, film, television, ballet, and opera.<br>
     <br>
     <h2>Tone and writing style</h2>
     The story of The Little Prince is recalled in a sombre, measured tone by the pilot-narrator, in memory of his small 
     friend, "a memorial to the prince—not just to the prince, but also to the time the prince and the narrator had together.
     " The Little Prince was created when Saint-Exupéry was "an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his 
     country and in the world."According to one analysis, "the story of the Little Prince features a lot of fantastical, 
     unrealistic elements.... You can't ride a flock of birds to another planet... The fantasy of the Little Prince works 
     because the logic of the story is based on the imagination of children, rather than the strict realism of adults."<br>
     <br>
     An exquisite literary perfectionist, akin to the 19th century French poet Stéphane Mallarmé, Saint-Exupéry produced 
     draft pages "covered with fine lines of handwriting, much of it painstakingly crossed out, with one word left standing 
     where there were a hundred words, one sentence substitut[ing] for a page..." He worked "long hours with great concentration.
     " According to the author himself, it was extremely difficult to start his creative writing processes.Biographer Paul Webster
      wrote of the aviator-author's style: "Behind Saint-Exupéry's quest for perfection was a laborious process of editing and 
      rewriting which reduced original drafts by as much as two-thirds."[24] The French author frequently wrote at night, usually 
      starting at about 11 p.m. accompanied by a tray of strong black coffee. In 1942 Saint-Exupéry related to his 
      American English teacher, Adèle Breaux, that at such a time of night he felt "free" and able to concentrate, 
      "writing for hours without feeling tired or sleepy", until he instantaneously dozed off.[22] He would wake up later,
       in daylight, still at his desk, with his head on his arms. Saint-Exupéry stated it was the only way he could work, 
       as once he started a writing project it became an obsession.<br>
       <br>
       Though the story is more or less understandable, the narrator made almost no connection from when the little prince 
       travelled between planets. He purposely did that so that the book felt like it was told from a secretive little boy.<br>
       <br>
       <h2>Background</h2>
       Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, a laureate of several of France's highest literary awards and a successful 
       pioneering aviator prior to the war, Saint-Exupéry initially flew with a reconnaissance squadron as a reserve 
       military pilot in the Armée de l'Air (French Air Force). After France's defeat in 1940 and its armistice with 
       Germany, he and Consuelo fled Occupied France and sojourned in North America, with Saint-Exupéry first arriving by 
       himself at the very end of December 1940. His intention for the visit was to convince the United States to quickly 
       enter the war against Nazi Germany and the Axis forces, and he soon became one of the expatriate voices of the 
       French Resistance. In the midst of personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings 
       for which he would be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love and loss, in the form of 
       a young prince visiting Earth.<br>
       <br>
       An earlier memoir by the author recounted his aviation experiences in the Sahara, and he is thought to have drawn 
       on the same experiences as plot elements in The Little Prince. <br>
       <br>
       He wrote and illustrated the manuscript during the summer and fall of 1942. Although greeted warmly by French-speaking 
       Americans and by fellow expatriates who had preceded him in New York, his 27-month stay would be marred by health 
       problems and racked with periods of severe stress, martial and marital strife. These included partisan attacks on 
       the author's neutral stance towards supporters of both ardent French Gaullist and Vichy France. Saint-Exupéry's 
       American translator (the author spoke poor English) wrote: "He was restless and unhappy in exile, seeing no way to 
       fight again for his country and refusing to take part in the political quarrels that set Frenchman against Frenchman.
       " However, the period was to be both a "dark but productive time" during which he created three important works.<br>
