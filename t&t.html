    <b>Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial (North American title: Trick or Treatment:</b> The Undeniable Facts 
    about Alternative Medicine)[1] is a 2008 book about alternative medicine by Simon Singh and Edzard Ernst.<br>
    <h2>Overview</h2>>
    The book evaluates the scientific evidence for acupuncture, homeopathy, herbal medicine, and chiropractic, and briefly 
    covers 36 other treatments. It finds that the scientific evidence for these alternative treatments is generally 
    lacking. Homeopathy is concluded to be completely ineffective: "It's nothing but a placebo, despite what homeopaths 
    say"<br>
    <br>
    Although <i>Trick or Treatment</i> presents evidence that acupuncture, chiropractic and herbal remedies have limited 
    efficacy for certain ailments, the authors conclude that the dangers of these treatments outweigh any potential 
    benefits. Such potential risks outlined by the authors are contamination or unexpected interactions between components 
    in the case of herbal medicine, risk of infection in the case of acupuncture and the potential for chiropractic 
    manipulation of the neck to cause delayed stroke. <br>
    <br>
    The book is very critical of Prince Charles' advocacy of alternative medicine and the actions of his now-defunct 
    The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. Trick or Treatment is dedicated, in an ironic fashion, to the Prince.<br>
    <h2>Reception</h2> 
    The book received generally good reviews. The New England Journal of Medicine's review said this about the authors: 
    "Simon Singh is a physicist and science journalist, and his coauthor, Edzard Ernst, is a physician and professor of 
    complementary medicine. Ernst is one of the best qualified people to summarize the evidence on this topic." The Daily 
    Telegraph found the book to be "a clearly written, scrupulously scientific examination of the health claims of key 
    areas of alternative medicine: acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic therapy and herbal medicine. The results are 
    stark. In no case, apart from in some limited ways in herbal medicine, do any of these 'therapies' work. On the 
    contrary, they can be life-threatening." The journal Nature tempered a generally positive review with a concern 
    that the authors' sense of certainty "mirrors that of the proponents of alternative therapies, leaving each position 
    as entrenched as ever."<br>
    <br>
    Trick or Treatment drew criticism from consumers and practitioners of alternative therapies. The British Journal 
    of General Practice published a review by Jeremy Swayne (former dean of the Faculty of Homeopathy) that was 
    critical of the book and its argument.<br>
    <br>
    A review by Harriet A. Hall on Quackwatch stated that some negative reviews of Trick or Treatment demonstrated "an 
    appalling poverty of thought"; articulating that since the reasoning behind the author's conclusions is solid, 
    critics instead deny the methods of science, misrepresent the book's contents and use ad hominem attacks against the 
    authors.<br>
