    <br>
    1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus is a 2005 non-fiction book by American author and science 
    writer Charles C. Mann about the pre-Columbian Americas. It was the 2006 winner of the National Academies 
    Communication Award for best creative work that helps the public understanding of topics in science, engineering or 
    medicine.<br>
    <br>
The book presents recent research findings in different fields that suggest human populations in the Western Hemisphere—
that is, the indigenous peoples of the Americas—were more numerous, had arrived earlier, were more sophisticated 
culturally, and controlled and shaped the natural landscape to a greater extent than scholars had previously thought.
<br>
The author notes that, according to these findings, two of the first six independent centers of civilization arose in the
 Americas: the first, Norte Chico or Caral-Supe, in present-day northern Peru; and that of Formative-era Mesoamerica in 
 what is now southern Mexico. 
 <br>
 <h2>summary</h2>
 Mann develops his arguments from a variety of recent re-assessments of longstanding views about the pre-Columbian world, 
 based on new findings in demography, climatology, epidemiology, economics, botany, genetics, image analysis, palynology, 
 molecular biology, biochemistry, and soil science. Although there is no consensus, and Mann acknowledges controversies, 
 he asserts that the general trend among scientists currently is to acknowledge: <br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) population levels in the Native Americans were probably higher than traditionally believed among scientists and 
 closer to the number estimated by "high counters."<br>
 (b) humans probably arrived in the Americas earlier than thought, over the course of multiple waves of migration to the 
 New World (not solely by the Bering land bridge over a relatively short period of time).<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of cultural advancement and the settlement range of humans was higher and broader than
  previously imagined.<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The New World was not a wilderness at the time of European contact, but an environment which 
  the indigenous peoples had altered for thousands of years for their benefit, mostly with fire.<br>
  <br>
  These three main foci (origins/population, culture, and environment) form the basis for three parts of the book.
<br>
  In the introduction, Mann attempts to refute the thesis that "Native Americans came across the Bering Strait 20,000 to 
  25,000 years ago, and they had so little impact on their environment that even after a millennia of habitation the 
  continents remained mostly wilderness." <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Reception</h2>
  A 2005 The New York Times book review stated that the book's approach is "in the best scientific tradition, carefully sifting the 
  evidence, never jumping to hasty conclusions, giving everyone a fair hearing -- the experts and the amateurs, the 
  accounts of the Indians and of their conquerors. And rarely is he less than enthralling.<br>
