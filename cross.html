    Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century is a report on health care quality in the United 
    States published by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) on March 1, 2001. A follow-up to the frequently cited 1999 IOM 
    patient safety report To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System, Crossing the Quality Chasm advocates for a 
    fundamental redesign of the U.S. health care system.<br>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    In the late 1990s, the IOM established a committee and formal program to study health care quality that lead to the 
    development of To Err Is Human and Crossing the Quality Chasm: the Committee on Quality of Health Care in America and 
    the Program on Quality of Health Care in America. They were inspired by an article published by the IOM-sponsored 
    National Roundtable on Health Care Quality in the Journal of the American Medical Association about the harm to 
    patients caused by medical errors. Simultaneously, the National Cancer Policy Board and the President's Advisory 
    Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry published similar reports.<br>
    <br>
    After the positive response to To Err Is Human, which focused purely on patient safety, IOM decided to publish a second, 
    more comprehensive report focused on the other problems and limitations of the existing U.S. health care system. 
    Crossing the Quality Chasm would focus more broadly on overuse (applying medical resources and treatments with 
    insufficient evidence that they lead to greater outcomes), underuse (failing to apply resources or treatments with 
    known benefits), and misuse (failing to execute care safely and correctly) of health care resources and treatments.<br>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    Crossing the Quality Chasm identifies and recommends improvements in six dimensions of health care in the U.S.: 
    patient safety, care effectiveness, patient-centeredness, timeliness, care efficiency, and equity. Safety looks at 
    reducing the likelihood that patients are harmed by medical errors. Effectiveness describes avoiding over and 
    underuse of resources and services. Patient-centeredness relates both to customer service and to considering and 
    accommodating individual patient needs when making care decisions. Timeliness emphasizes reducing wait times. 
    Efficiency focuses on reducing waste and, as a result, total cost of care. Equity looks at closing racial and income 
    gaps in health care.<br>
    <br>
    Given limitations of the existing U.S. health care system, it proposes a new framework for health care with four levels to 
    address the six dimensions: A: Patient experiences, B: Care-giving microsystems, C: Organizations that house and 
    support care-giving microsystems, and D: Legal, financial, and educational environment (e.g., laws, payment, 
    accreditation, professional training). It also discusses obstacles to change across these dimensions and levels.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Level A: Patient experiences</u><br>
    <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; The first recommendation in Crossing the Quality Chasm relates to setting patient-centric goals for improving the U.S. 
    health care system. It proposes making clear, comprehensive, and bold goals for quality improvement and that those goals
     should focus on improving patient experiences, the cost to each patient, and equity across disparate racial and income
      populations. This is in contrast to developing hospital- or physician-centric goals that emphasize the needs of 
      health care organizations and providers.<br>
      <br>
    <u>Level B: Care-giving microsystems</u><br>
    <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing the Quality Chasm defines a microcosm as small groups of people, information system(s), client population, and processes (e.g. a local hospital's
       night shift Emergency Department staff or a cardiac surgery team). It also includes the staff and systems which 
       provide IT solutions related to health care.<br>
       <br>
    <u>Level C: Organizations that house and support care-giving microsystems</u><br>
    <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing the Quality Chasm recommends six organizational changes to not only fix problems in the existing
      U.S. health care system but to allow health care organizations to thrive long-term.<br>
     <br>
      1. Better systems for identifying best practices and ensuring that these best practices become organizational 
     standards<br>
     2. Better use of information technology to a) access information and b) support clinical decision making.<br>
     3. Greater investment in workforce training and skill development.<br>
     4. Better team coordination.<br>
     5. Improved care coordination across and within services and organizations, particularly for patients with chronic 
     conditions.<br>
     6. Better performance measurement.<br>
     <br>
     It also recommends that United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) invest resources in making 
     clinical best practices easy to access nationwide and support a health care information system infrastructure that 
     includes "the elimination of most handwritten clinical data by the end of the decade.‚Äù<br>
