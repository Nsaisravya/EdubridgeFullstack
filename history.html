  <h3>History is the study of change over time, and it covers all aspects of human society. Political, 
    social, economic, scientific, technological, medical, cultural, intellectual, religious and military 
    developments are all part of history. Usually professional historians specialize in a particular aspect of 
    history, a specific time period, a certain approach to history or a specific geographic region.</h3>
     <h4>History also includes the academic discipline which uses narrative to describe, examine, question, and 
         analyze past events, and investigate their patterns of cause and effect.Historians often debate which 
         narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects. Historians also
          debate the nature of history as an end in itself, as well as its usefulness to give perspective on the 
          problems of the present.<br>
        <br>
        Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur),
         are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends.History differs from myth in that it is supported 
         by evidence. However, ancient cultural influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history
         which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and 
         includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematic elements of historical 
         investigation. History is often taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history 
         is a major discipline in university studies.</h4>
