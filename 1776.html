    1776 (released in the United Kingdom as 1776: America and Britain at War)[1] is a book written by David McCullough, 
    published by Simon & Schuster on May 24, 2005. The work is a companion to McCullough's earlier biography of John 
    Adams, and focuses on the events surrounding the start of the American Revolutionary War. While revolving mostly 
    around the leadership (and often indecisiveness) of George Washington, there is also considerable attention given 
    to King George III, William Howe, Henry Knox, and Nathanael Greene. Key Revolutionary War battles detailed in the 
    book include the Battle of Dorchester Heights, the Battle of Long Island, and the Battle of Trenton.[2] The 
    activities of the Second Continental Congress and the signing of the Declaration of Independence are treated in less 
    detail, as the focus is on military rather than political events. The book includes multiple pages of full color 
    illustrations, including portraits and historical battlefield maps made by British engineers at the time.

    <h2>Illustrated Edition</h2>
    1776: The Illustrated Edition was released on October 2, 2007. The Illustrated Edition contains 140 images and 
    thirty-seven removable replicas of 
    source documents. More than three dozen source documents—including a personal letter George Washington penned to 
    Martha about his commission, a note informing the mother of a Continental Army soldier that her son has been taken 
    prisoner, and a petition signed by Loyalists pledging their allegiance to the King—are re-created in uniquely 
    designed envelopes throughout the book and secured with the congressional seal.

    The text closely mirrors the original book, but omits or summarizes some parts deemed too long. The Illustrated Edition 
    comes with its own protective slipcase, decorated with The Capture of the Hessians at Trenton, December 26, 1776 by 
    John Trumbull and has a "fake watermark" of the Great Seal of the United States on the back and front. The book is 
    plain covered in blue with the golden embossed numbers "1776". 
    <h2>Reception</h2>
    1776 was selected as part of the 2005 and 2006 CSAF Professional Reading Program.[3] 1776 is also a New York Times and 
    Amazon bestseller.
